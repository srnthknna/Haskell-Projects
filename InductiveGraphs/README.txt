Instructions to run the project:-

1> Run the project from current folder with ":l assign7.hs" command.
2> Open slide 8 in haskell.ppt submitted along with the assign.hs.
3> The example in the slide is represented as inputGraph2 statically.
4> Try running it using :-
	To view the graph structure  -> inputGraph2
        For DFS 		     -> dfs (node inputGraph2) (inputGraph2)
	For BFS   		     -> bfs (node inputGraph2) (inputGraph2)
5> Check the BFS and DFS result with the graph structure in slide.
6> To try for different graph structures, have to create new graphs similar to the way it is created 
   in assign7.hs at the bottom represented as inputGraph2.
